There are so many different types of gel treatments in the world of beauty that can be confusing to customers who are not experienced. This quiz aims to find the best treatment for them in a fun way. 

1. A page where users can complete a quiz to see what treament would be best suited to them 
2. The quiz will return treatment options to the user 
3. The page will then let them retake the quiz or link to the contact option for them to either call, email or use the contact form to contact the salon

2. A place where people can request to book with the salon if they don't want to call and book an appointment 
3. The contact number and email of the salon will also be available here for customers to book an appointment


My business goals for this website are:

1. To attract customers to book an appointment at the salon
2. To give customers inspiration on nail art designs through the gallery page
3. To help customers decide what treatment is best for them 
4. To give them the contact information of the salon

The user goals of this website are:

1. To be able to learn more about the salon
2. To view the pricing of the treaments 
3. To get help with what treament service they would like if they are unsure with the gallery page and the quiz

# UX

## Strategy
--------------

Considering the core UX principles I first started to think about the strategy for this website and defined who the target users would be and what features/technologies they would want.

Beau Belle target users are:

Aged 20-60 primarily women 

What these users would be looking for:

Clear, concise, easy-to-read information on the pricing 

Great photos of treatments that show off the beauticians work 

Help with what treatments are better for them

## Surface
--------------

I chose a colour palette based around the logo colours, I put the image into a search engine and copied the colour of the lofo. I wanted this to be reflected on the website. I paired these colours with a dark grey and black font to stand out around the base colour. 

### Colormind

Using the colormind palette on the Beau Belle Logo I selected the colours from this palette and also darker and lighter shades of these colours to create a better contrast.

I used Google fonts 'Montserrat', I felt 'Montserrat' was very easy to read and looks professional.

## Features
--------------

This is a fully responsive website that was designed mobile-first as this is the most likely way it will be viewed; the website is divided into the five pages listed in the navbar. All of the headings use the font Montserrat and the body too, this consistency has been used across the website to create a coherent design. 

## Navbar & Footer

The navbar is comprised of a logo and navigation links to the other pages on the site. You can see how the navbar turns into a toggled dropdown menu when viewed on mobile.

## Home

The home page is made with warm and calm colours to entice customers to the website and show the calming feminine energy of the studio. It gives an overview of the salon and gives you the option to go straight to the contact page if you know what treatment you are looking to book.

## Quiz 

This page is an interactive quiz for users who are unsure on what treatment they require at Beau Belle salon. There are so many different types of gel treatments in the world of beauty that it can be confusing to customers who are not experienced in the beauty world. This quiz aims to find the best treatment for them in a fun way.

## Usability Testing 
------------

### Navigation 

I tested the navigation with the test subject being a user who wants to book in a nail treatment with Beau Belle Salon for the first time but is unsure what to book. 

On opening the website there is initial information on the salon with a clear button that takes you to the booking page if you were confident in the treatment you wanted to book. 

The gallery page shows the skills of the nail artist at the salon clearly, it is responsive to mobile and desktop. 

The pricing page has a very clear layout of the treatment options available.

The quiz page functions well on mobile and desktop, it helps users by allowing them to select options they prefer and provided the perfect treatment option for them. 

The contact page is clear in the navbar, you can click and get in contact with the team. Either by using the contact information provided or using the contact form that currently redirects to my email address.
