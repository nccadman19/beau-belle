# User Experience UX

## Strategy
--------------

Considering the core UX principles I first started to think about the strategy for this website and defined who the target users would be and what features/technologies they would want.

Beau Belle target users are:

Aged 20-60 primarily women 

What these users would be looking for:

Clear, concise, easy-to-read information on the pricing 

Great photos of treatments that show off the beauticians work 

Help with what treatments are better for them

Somewhere to contact us

## Wireframes

## Surface
--------------

I chose a colour palette based around the logo colours, I put the image into a search engine and copied the colour of the lofo. I wanted this to be reflected on the website. I paired these colours with a dark grey and black font to stand out around the base colour. 

### Colormind

Using the colormind palette on the Beau Belle Logo I selected the colours from this palette and also darker and lighter shades of these colours to create a better contrast.

![Colormind](assets/images/readme/colormind.png)

I used Google fonts 'Montserrat', I felt 'Montserrat' was very easy to read and looks professional.

## Features
--------------

This is a fully responsive website that was designed mobile-first as this is the most likely way it will be viewed; the website is divided into the five pages listed in the navbar. All of the headings use the font Montserrat and the body too, this consistency has been used across the website to create a coherent design. 

## Navbar & Footer

The navbar is comprised of a logo and navigation links to the other pages on the site. You can see how the navbar turns into a toggled dropdown menu when viewed on mobile.

## Home

The home page is made with warm and calm colours to entice customers to the website and show the calming feminine energy of the studio. It gives an overview of the salon and gives you the option to go straight to the contact page if you know what treatment you are looking to book.

Features: 

1. Navbar with logo, name of nail salon and nav bar links to other pages

## Usability Testing 
------------

### Navigation 

I tested the navigation with the test subject being a user who wants to book in a nail treatment with Beau Belle Salon for the first time but is unsure what to book. 

On opening the website there is initial information on the salon with a clear button that takes you to the booking page if you were confident in the treatment you wanted to book. 

The gallery page shows the skills of the nail artist at the salon clearly, it is responsive to mobile and desktop. 

The pricing page has a very clear layout of the treatment options available.

The quiz page functions well on mobile and desktop, it helps users by allowing them to select options they prefer and provided the perfect treatment option for them. 

The contact page is clear in the navbar, you can click and get in contact with the team. Either by using the contact information provided or using the contact form that currently redirects to my email address.

# Github Deployment

## Preparation

* To prepare for using GitHub, you can either copy or clone the repository for direct deployment. 
* To get started, you'll need a free GitHub account, a free EmailJS account and preferably some kind of image editor.

## Instructions

1. To set up your repository on GitHub, log in to your account and navigate to https://github.com/nccadman19/beau-belle.

## Media

All hero images were downloaded from sources with a free license and do not require attribution. I chose images that matched with the logo to create a  The gallery images and logo were taken from the [Beau Belle Facebook Page ](XXX) (this was verbally authorised by the manager for use on my project). The images were resized and compressed using [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html). The favicon media at the footer was generated from the stock images on the [Favicon Website](https://favicon.io). The pricing guide was created on [Canva Website](https://www.canva.com/en_gb/) using a free price list template. Lastly, I used [Adobe Dreamweaver](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/dreamweaver.html) to create the wireframes for this site.
